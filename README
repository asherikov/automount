automounta is a devd(8) based automounter for FreeBSD based on 'automount'
script developed by Slawomir Wojciech Wojtczak and available at
'https://github.com/vermaden/automount'.


Main differences from automount:
    1) automounta is implemented as an rc script, and can be enabled/disabled
    in rc.conf

    2) automounta does not track states of mounted devices.

    3) automounta can identify a particular 'da*' device using 'camcontrol
    inquiry da*' and apply custom parameters to this device.

    4) Messages are logged to '/var/log/messages'

    5) Some configuration parameters were removed, but can be reintroduced if
    needed.


Refer to automounta.conf for decription of supported configuration parameters.


Installation:

# cp automounta             /usr/local/etc/rc.d/automounta
# echo 'automounta_enable = "YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf
# cp automounta.conf        /usr/local/etc/automounta.conf
# cp automounta_devd.conf   /usr/local/etc/devd/automounta_devd.conf
# /etc/rc.d/devd restart


WARNING:
Only basic functionality is tested on FFS and FAT filesystems. The code is
sloppy and likely to contain bugs.
